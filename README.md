# Hospital Monitoring

Monitoring patient transport activity in a hospital with AI. 

In this repository you will find the Repast-Symphony Java Project that we made to simulate patient transport activity in a hospital. 
The system is composed of 2 agents or robots and 1 concierge that welcomes patients. Patients can have different severity degrees when they arrive, and should thus be treated in different rooms before leaving the hospital. 
Our environement is a 12*16 grid representing the emergency department of the hospital, and is composed of several rooms, an entry and an exit. 

Every detail concerning agents, environment and interactions is described in the report available in this repository. The description of the classes can be found under hospital/src.
